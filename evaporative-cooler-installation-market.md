<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooler Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Downdraft</li><li>Sidedraft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative cooler installation market is categorized primarily into two types: downdraft and sidedraft systems. Downdraft coolers operate by drawing hot air from above, cooling it, and then distributing the cooler air downwards, making them ideal for areas with high ceilings. Sidedraft coolers, on the other hand, pull air from the sides, cooling it before discharging it horizontally. Each type offers distinct advantages based on building design and ventilation needs, catering to diverse climates and preferences for effective cooling solutions.</p></p>
