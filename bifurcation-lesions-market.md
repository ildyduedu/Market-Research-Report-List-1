<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bifurcation Lesions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Stent</li><li>Two-Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bifurcation lesions refer to coronary artery blockages that occur at a branching point. The market for treating these lesions is characterized by two primary approaches: the One-Stent and Two-Stent techniques. The One-Stent technique involves the placement of a single stent to address both branches, aiming for simplicity and reduced risk of complications. In contrast, the Two-Stent technique utilizes separate stents for each branch, providing enhanced support but potentially increasing complexity and procedural duration. Both markets cater to varying patient needs and anatomical challenges.</p></p>
